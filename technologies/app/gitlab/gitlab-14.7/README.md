# Gitlab CE

![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/saagie/gitlab/ce-0.1?label=ce-0.1%20image%20size&style=for-the-badge)

## Description
This directory contains version of Gitlab CE contenairized and customized for Saagie Platform.

Current restrictions : 
- The Docker images donâ€™t include a mail transport agent (MTA) (see [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/docker.html) for more details). If you want to configure Gitlab with your own SMTP Server, add the [corresponding configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/smtp.html) into the `gitlab.rb` file and rebuild this image.`
- SSH protocol is not available with Saagie Apps so HTTP must be used when using this App as your Git Repository


## Deployment
:information_source: This App is storing a large amount of data in the embedded PostgreSQL database. You need to configure at least 5Gb of storage in your Saagie App in order for it to work properly. 

Before launching this app, make sure the following environment variables are configured within your project : 
- `GITLAB_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD` : initial password of the `root` user, must be changed after first login
- `SAAGIE_PLATFORM_URL` : e.g. `http://mycompany-workspace.hostname.io` must be specified in order for Gitlab to configure the relative url. 
  - :warning: You must specify a http endpoint and not a https because https will force Gitlab to self register certificates on lets encrypt. 
  - :warning: Do not add a trailing slash in your url. 
  
This version of Gitlab CE is using a bundled PostgreSQL database. if you wish to use you own external PostgreSQL database, add the [corresponding configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#using-a-non-packaged-postgresql-database-management-server) into the `gitlab.rb` file and rebuild this image.`




## Administration

### User creation
As there is no SMTP server, you don't have the possibility to reset passwords nor create users via the root user.
In order to create a new user, you must activate user self registration (activated by default) and let users self register. Once done, the root user must activate this pending account via the admin `Users` panel.
